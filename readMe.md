## List of Features / User Stories
For the project I planned to be able to:
 * Start the game on its own page
* Switch pages once button is pressed
* Having different colored labels
* Having a picture of the country flag pop up once a answer was selected
* Having a page that told you if the answer was right or wrong after each selection
* Tracking score and question number throughout
* Animated background

I was not able to do an animated background because it was a lot more difficult than i thought. However, I was able to complete everything else.

## List of Features / User Stories
For the project I planned to be able to:
 * Start the game on its own page
* Switch pages once button is pressed
* Having different colored labels
* Having a picture of the country flag pop up once a answer was selected
* Having a page that told you if the answer was right or wrong after each selection
* Tracking score and question number throughout
* Animated background

I was not able to do an animated background because it was a lot more difficult than i thought. However, I was able to complete everything else.

##Issues throughout the process:
I wrote everything else I needed to create in my javascript but ended up just writing one big function. I had to restart because I was getting lost having everything in one block of code. Learned about the importance of breaking things apart into simpler pieces and console logging things to see what was being accessed.
